		<p>An international team of rescuers was racing against time on
			Tuesday to search an area of the North Atlantic larger than
			Connecticut for a deep-diving submersible and its five occupants,
			with less than two days of oxygen believed to be remaining on board
			and a staggering list of logistical challenges complicating the
			operation. 
			The submersible, the Titan, was more than halfway into
			what should have been a two-and-a-half-hour dive to the ruins of the
			Titanic when it lost contact with a chartered research ship on Sunday
			morning. Leaders in the submersible craft industry had warned for
			years of possible “catastrophic” problems with the craft’s design,
			and worried that the Titan had not followed standard certification
			procedures. 
			Operated by OceanGate Expeditions, which has provided
			tours of the Titanic wreck since 2021, the submersible was believed
			to have set out with 96 hours’ worth of oxygen. As of 1 p.m. Eastern
			time Tuesday, the craft probably had about 40 hours of breathable air
			left, said Capt. Jamie Frederick of the U.S. Coast Guard. 
			Search
			aircraft from the United States and Canada have been scanning the
			surface, while sonar buoys have been pinging the depths in hopes of
			locating the lost submersible, Captain Frederick said.</p>
